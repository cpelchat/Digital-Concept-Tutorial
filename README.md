### In this tutorial we will be learning how to use SVG to create unique designs digitally.

This tutorial is for those who want a intro into **SVG** and have no past
experience.

First what is Scalable Vector Graphics?
**SVG** 
is a XML - based vector image format used for 2D graphics with support for
interactivity and animation, also **SVG** images can be created and edited
with any text editor and with drawing software.

One of the best websites to learn **SVG** is [www.w3schools.com] they also
have a number of other tech related tutorials that may catch your interest.

For this tutorial the goal is to try and create the image below:

But before we begin it might be beneficial to go through [w3school's SVG Polyline]
examples to familiarize yourself with using Polyline and to get a feel for it.

Once you feel comfortable click the link below and delete the code on the left
